Universal USB Installer
To try out a Linux distribution, you no longer need to download cumbersome image files and then burn them to a CD or DVD. The "Universal USB Installer" makes it easy and allows you to choose your favorite from a large list of different Linux operating systems or rescue CDs and put it on a USB stick with a few clicks.

Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Fedora or openSUSE: The tool already suggests numerous free Linux distributions and leads you to the download link. Antivirus rescue kits from Avira or Kaspersky are also included in the list. Also included are useful tools for partitioning the hard drives or testing the hardware.

Windows users can also work with the tool, but you have to get the ISO files from Microsoft or create them yourself from a data carrier. However, the tool links to the "Windows 8 Release Preview".

Tip: If you want to accommodate several operating systems on one stick, simply use YUMI from the same manufacturer.
